task_1
The exercise consisted in getting to know different coordinate systems and their conversion
on the example of the obtained airport and airplane coordinates in a given time series.
Data should have been:
‚Ä¢ convert to the spatial rectangular coordinate system (xyz) with respect to GRS80 ellipsoids.
‚Ä¢ determine the topocentric coordinates (neu) with respect to the aerodrome.
‚Ä¢ Convert coordinates (neu) into oblique distance, azimuths and zenith distance plane.
‚Ä¢ determine the moment when the plane disappears below the horizon in relation to the starting aerodrome.
‚Ä¢ present the results in graphs.
Flight data DLH1350 from Frankfurt Airport (FRA) to the Airport Warsaw Chopin Airport (WAW) was selected, downloaded from flightaware.com.
The MATLAB environment was used to perform the exercise

task_2
The aim of the exercise was to select a star and analyze its motion in the sky during one day from
three positions on Earth: in the southern hemisphere, in the northern hemisphere, and around the equator.
It was necessary to download the declination and right ascension of the selected star, and then these data for everyone
places:
‚Ä¢ Convert to horizontal coordinates (Az, h).
‚Ä¢ Present the obtained coordinates on a plot of altitude versus time and
azimuth from time.
‚Ä¢ Create a horizontal representation of the star's path on the sphere.
The MATLAB environment was used to perform the exercise 

The star Sadalsuud, the brightest star in the Aquarius constellation, was selected for observation.
The date of observation was January 24, 2001, and three cities were selected as the places: Warsaw (hemisphere
northern), Buenos Aires (southern hemisphere) and Libreville (equatorial area).

task_3
The aim of the exercise was to get acquainted with spherical trigonometry and to determine the data of four
points on Earth:
‚Ä¢ the midpoint between two points using Vincent's and Kivioj's algorithm.
‚Ä¢ mid-latitude point.
‚Ä¢ the difference in distances between these points and their azimuths.
‚Ä¢ The area of the quadrilateral formed by the points.
The Python programming language version 3.10 in the PyCharm Community Edition environment was used to perform the exercise.

task_4
The aim of the exercise was to :
‚Ä¢ recalculate geodetic coordinates according to the GRS80 ellipsoid of six points per coordinate in three different systems:
  - Gauss-Kr√ºger mapping
  - System 1992 (PL-1992)
  - System 2000 (PL-2000) 
‚Ä¢ calculate an elementary length scale
‚Ä¢ calculate the distortion for 1km. 
Additionally, the area of the rectangle had to be calculated from four points, 
calculation of the scale of surface areas and distortions per 1ha.
The Python programming language version 3.10 in the PyCharm Community Edition environment was used to perform the exercise.

task_5
The exercise consisted in transforming the coordinates ùúë ùúÜ of six points from the GRS80 ellipsoid into
ùúë ùúÜ coordinates of the Krasowski ellipsoid using the Hirvonen algorithm and the Bursa-Wolf transformation.
The Python programming language version 3.10 in the PyCharm environment was used to perform the exercise
Community Edition.
